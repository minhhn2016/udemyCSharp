Q : Where do i extract the files i downloaded?

A : Open the file you downloaded with .rar . Then, drag/drop or copy/paste the files inside the folder 
"Files", into the Editor Data folder which can be found at this location : 

PC – My Documents > Sports Interactive > Football Manager 2017 > editor data
MAC – Documents > Sports Interactive > Football Manager 2017 > editor data .

If the folder "Editor Data" is not there , you have to create it, ONLY with this name , or else the files 
won't work correctly.



Q : How do I load my file into my game inside FM?

A : Extract the files to : C:\Users\user\Documents\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2017\editor data. If editor data folder is not there, create one with this name only. Other names will not recognize the files inside the game. 

Then New Career Game. Choose the Football Manager 2017 database option and select my files. You are ready to create an updated new game.
